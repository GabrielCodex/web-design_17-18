# Web Design Class - Assessment

## Trimester 1 - HTML, CSS, wireframing, commenting, designing from scratch, and collaboration

# Team Project: Portal Page

## Each team will design and create a portal page that will feature all the individual student pages, with a small description of the site and/or the site creator

Divide the class into pairs for this project. This can be done randomly or by student request.

## Team **Tasks**

- Design a wireframe for the site using markers and (portable) white boards
- Choose **Title** and **Subheader** for display on portal pages
- Build the site using **CodeAnywhere**

## Website Requirements

- Multiple .html pages
- Single CSS page that is used for all .html pages
- Each **student site** should have a thumbnail, short name, and 1-2 sentence description
- First **.html page** should include 3 short paragraphs about the team designing the portal, including who they are and what they are trying to showcase, using their own style.
- See list below of requirements for **HTML** tags and **CSS** rule-sets

## HTML requirements

- Create an Images folder and store all the image files in that folder (you can upload using CodeAnywhere)
- Use of `<div>` and `<span>` elements in the 3 text paragraphs, with styling defined in CSS
- Use a minimum of 5 HTML Tags **inline,** in your HTML files. These tags should work independent of the CSS file (e.g. `<bold>test</bold>`)
- Use **HTML Comment Tags** to describe each part of the site and explain your work

## CSS requirements

- Background color
- Image size
- H1 styling
- Include `id`, `class`, and `tag` selectors in your CSS file
- Use at least one example where you **combine** multiple CSS selectors
- Use of **Image animation** or other filter
- Use **CSS Comments** to describe and explain your work

## Bonus

Have the description of an image apear only when you **hover** over the image, but hidden all other times.
