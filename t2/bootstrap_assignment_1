# Web Design Class - Bootstrap Assignment #1

## Trimester 2 - Using the Boostrap framework to design responsive, mobile-first websites

# Individual Project: Mobile Ready Page using Bootstrap 

- Build the site using [**CodeAnywhere**](https://codeanywhere.com/)

- Create  `index.html` and `style.css` pages in the **/Boostrap** folder 

## Website Requirements

- Site needs to have multiple HTML pages, with links to the other pages on each page.
- Single CSS page that is used for all HTML pages
- Each **student site** should have a thumbnail, short name, and 1-2 sentence description
- One **Html** page should be titled **about** and include 3 or more short paragraphs about the team designing the portal, including who they are and what they are trying to showcase, using their own style. You can add pictures of your **wireframe** board on this page.
- See list below of requirements for **HTML** tags and **CSS** rule-sets

## HTML requirements

- Create an Images folder and store all the [image files](https://github.com/lrei-coding/web-design_17-18/tree/master/resources/images) in that folder (you can upload using CodeAnywhere). You will need to use **relative paths** for all **but one image**
- Use an **absolute path** for one image 
- Use of `<div>` and `<span>` elements in the 3 text paragraphs, with styling defined in CSS
- Use a minimum of 5 HTML Tags **inline,** in your HTML files. These tags should work independent of the CSS file (e.g. `<bold>test</bold>`)
- Use **HTML Comment Tags** to describe each part of the site and explain your work

## CSS requirements

- Background color
- Image size
- H1 styling
- Include `id`, `class`, and `tag` selectors in your CSS file
- Use at least one example where you **combine** multiple CSS selectors
- Use of an **Image animation** filter or something similar
- Use **CSS Comments** to describe and explain your work

## Bonus

Have the description of an image apear only when you **hover** over the image, but hidden all other times.
